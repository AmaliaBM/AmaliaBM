## Hi there 👋 You might be wondering, who is Amalia?

I hope this short introduction helps you get to know me better.


💻 I'm a full stack web developer passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly, and impactful web solutions.🚀, 

I’m also a designer, specializing in UX/UI with experience in Figma 🎨. I’m proficient in practically the entire Adobe suite and skilled in digital vector illustration ✏️✨.

As if that weren’t enough, I’m currently studying Psychology as a personal challenge 🎓🧠. Within this field, I’m deeply focused on neuropsychology, psychobiology, and everything related to neurodivergence 🌀🧬


In my free time, I love spending time in nature 🌿🌞, reading great books 📚, and doing sports 🏃‍♀️⚽.
I have a cat named Buzz (after Buzz Aldrin, the astronaut 🚀🐱), and I treat him like a king 👑.
A few months ago, I also had a dog named London 🐶❤️, but after a long time, she crossed the rainbow bridge 🌈🐾 (you’ll see a retro 8-bit style video game dedicated to her in my repositories).


**If you want to meet me or have any questions, feel free to connect! 🤝**
